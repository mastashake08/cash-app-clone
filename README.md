> Thank you everyone who supported this master class and made this possible.

## What Are We Making?

This application is a cash app clone that utilizes the Stripe API to send and receive payments. Users will sign up through Stripe using the Laravel Socialite package, with a React.js frontend to consume our Laravel APIs. This app is a progressive web application and can be installed on desktop/tablet/mobile.

## Installation

> From the project root run the following
- cp .env.example .env
- edit .env database info
- composer install
- npm install
- php artisan key:generate
- php artisan passport:install
- php artisan migrate
